# EcoScape

The EcoScape project aims at modeling animal (and perhaps, in the future, plant) habitats, study their connectivity, and more. 

The project so far consists of the following repositories: 

* [SCGT](https://github.com/ecoscape-earth/scgt), the UC Santa Cruz Geographical Toolkit, contains functions for working with geotiff files. 
* [ecoscape-layers](https://github.com/ecoscape-earth/ecoscape-layers) contains functions for generating habitat and landcover layers for bird species. 
* [ecoscape-connectivity](https://github.com/ecoscape-earth/ecoscape-connectivity) is the tool for computing habitat connectivity. 
* [ecoscape-utils](https://github.com/ecoscape-earth/ecoscape-utils) is a collection of utilities that facilitate working on habitats and landscapes.
